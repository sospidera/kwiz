# kwiz - a simple true/false quiz app

Created using [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) and thus uses the [Expo](https://expo.io/) mobile app and [expo-cli](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli) to run the react-native app on a mobile device, so install those two tools before running this app.

After cloning, make sure the mobile device and computer are on the same wifi network. You also may need to set a `REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME` environment variable to your computer's local IP address. 

Run the standard npm commands: 

```
npm install
npm start
```

Once the QR code is displayed in the terminal, open the Expo mobile app, select "Scan QR Code", and scan the code to open the Kwiz app.
